how to use:

if you want to use the compiled version of the AutocompleteSearch widget just
copy the AutocompleteSearch folder from the compilede-folder into your widget-folder
put this in your config.xml

<widget label="AutocompledeSearch" left="60" top="400"
    			preload="open"
    			icon="assets/images/i_search.png"   
				config="widgets/AutocompleteSearch/AutocompleteSearch.xml" 
				url="widgets/AutocompleteSearch/AutocompleteSearch.swf"/>
				
alter the AutocompleteSearch.xml file to point it to your url, complete description inside the XML

to use the uncompiled version copy the folder in the SourceCode folder to your widget-folder in your project,
copy the AutoComplete-1.1-Fx4.swc into the libs folder in your project, make sure you add the AutocompleteSearch.mxml
to the modules in the project-properties.
